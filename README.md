# Unicorn-Companies
Some of the challenges experienced  are:
Time limitation
The dataset is not complete and not up-to-date, as new unicorns emerge and existing ones change their status over time. Therefore, the analysis may not reflect the current or accurate situation of the unicorn market.
The dataset contains errors and inconsistencies, such as missing values, outliers and duplicates, Therefore, the analysis may be affected by the quality and reliability of the data.
The dataset is not representative or generalizable, as it only covers a subset of all the potential unicorns in the world. Therefore, the analysis did not capture the diversity and complexity of the unicorn phenomenon.
The dataset is not sufficient, as it only provides limited information about each unicorn company. Therefore, the analysis did address the deeper or broader questions or issues related to the unicorn phenomenon.
